This project is a Python application for Raspberry Pi 5 that turns the device into a standalone camera using one or two attached CSI cameras. It also supports displaying information and images on an Adafruit 240x240 PiTFT using CircuitPython. Prioritize code that works efficiently on Raspberry Pi hardware and integrates with CSI cameras and CircuitPython display libraries.
