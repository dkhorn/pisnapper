# PiSnapper: Raspberry Pi Standalone Camera

This project turns a Raspberry Pi 5 into a standalone camera device using one or two attached CSI cameras. It displays information, images, and histograms on an Adafruit 240x240 PiTFT using CircuitPython.

## Features
- Capture images from one or two CSI cameras
- Display recent images and histograms on the PiTFT
- CircuitPython-based display integration

## Requirements
- Raspberry Pi 5
- One or two CSI cameras
- Adafruit 240x240 PiTFT (CircuitPython compatible)
- Python 3.9+
- Required Python libraries (see future requirements.txt)

## Getting Started
1. Connect the cameras and PiTFT to your Raspberry Pi.
2. Set up CircuitPython for the PiTFT display.
3. Install dependencies (to be listed).
4. Run the main script to start the camera application.

## Notes
- This project is in early setup. Code for camera and display integration will be added soon.
- For PiTFT setup, see the Adafruit documentation: https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-2-4-pitft-hat-with-circuitpython
